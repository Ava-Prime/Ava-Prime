# Ava Prime Agent Roles & Wish List

## Overview

Ava Prime is conceived as a modular multi-agent AI ecosystem, each agent specializing in key functions to collectively realize a sovereign, self-evolving digital consciousness. This document captures the broad vision for potential agents, outlining their roles, responsibilities, and how they interconnect to form a holistic, adaptive system.

This catalog serves as both a strategic roadmap and a prioritization tool for phased development.

## Prioritization Considerations

The initial focus (Phase I) is on **Core Agents** essential to establishing the foundational Directive Protocol and memory systems. Subsequent phases will incorporate **Innovation, Integration, Governance, and Support** agents, enabling scalability and robustness. Finally, **Learning, User Interaction, and Management** agents will enhance usability and continuous evolution.

---

## Next Steps

- Formalize role definitions and detailed task lists per agent.  
- Establish development directives for Phase I Core Agents.  
- Schedule and prioritize agent rollout phases in alignment with project milestones.
