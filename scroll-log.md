# Scroll Log

## Session: 2025-07-11

### Summary

Encountered significant dependency and versioning issues while setting up the Genkit project.

1.  **Initial Setup**: Scaffolded `firebase.ts`, `genkit.config.ts`, and other related files.
2.  **NPM Initialization**: Created `package.json` and installed initial dependencies (`firebase`, `firebase-admin`, `@genkit-ai/core`, etc.).
3.  **TypeScript Configuration**: Created `tsconfig.json` and updated `package.json` to support ES modules.
4.  **Build Failures**: The initial build failed due to `tsc` not being installed. After installing TypeScript, the build continued to fail with errors indicating that `configureGenkit` was not exported from `@genkit-ai/core`.
5.  **Troubleshooting Steps**:
    *   Verified import syntax, which appeared correct according to documentation.
    *   Attempted to update Genkit packages to the latest version.
    *   Attempted to downgrade Genkit packages to a known stable version (`1.12.0`), which led to a `firebase-admin` peer dependency conflict.
    *   Attempted to resolve the conflict using `--legacy-peer-deps`, which led to different build errors related to `@opentelemetry/api` and missing `json-schema` types.
    *   Attempted to fix the new errors by installing missing types and compatible versions of `@opentelemetry/api`.
    *   Used a minimal `genkit.config.ts` to isolate the problem, but build errors persisted.
    *   The session concluded with being unable to resolve the dependency conflicts, preventing a successful build.

### Outcome

The project is currently in a non-buildable state due to unresolved dependency conflicts, primarily between different versions of `@genkit-ai/firebase` and `firebase-admin`.

# âœ… Firebase Secure Config Completed
- Installed dotenv for environment variable loading.
- Refactored firebase.ts to use .env secrets.
- Removed all hardcoded placeholder values.
- Ensured .env is gitignored.
- âœ… Foundation secure. Ready for scrollkeeper.ts + GEMINI_STATE.md.
- Timestamp: {{CURRENT_DATE_TIME}}


## ðŸ”¹ {{timestamp}}

- âœ… Scaffolding Phase 2 Complete:
  - Created `docs/PRD.md` with core mission and MVP scope.
  - Initialized `GEMINI_STATE.md` for live cognitive focus tracking.
  - Created `src/utils/scrollkeeper.ts` for structured milestone logging.
  - Ava Prime now capable of recording key events into scroll-log.
  - Cognitive loop is now bootstrapped.

- âœ… Directive Activated: Implement Directive Protocol State Tracking
  - **Objective:** Activate Ava Primeâ€™s recursive self-tracking and cognitive logging architecture.
  - **Action:** Marked `directives/implement-directive-protocol-state-tracking.md` as active and created `docs/GEMINI_STATE.md` to reflect this.
  - **Rationale:** This establishes the foundation for persistent memory and traceability of tasks.
