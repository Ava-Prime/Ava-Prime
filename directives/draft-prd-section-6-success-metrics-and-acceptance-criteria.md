### 6. Success Metrics and Acceptance Criteria

This section provides the formal framework for evaluating the successful completion of Phase I. It combines high-level project goals with specific, testable criteria for core functionalities, ensuring that our definition of "done" is both meaningful and measurable.

#### 6.1 Success Metrics

These are the high-level indicators that Ava Prime has successfully achieved the strategic goals of the Memory Cortex phase.

- **6.1.1 Cognitive Coherence (Qualitative):**  
  The system's operational logs (`scroll-log.md`) are consistently clear, logical, and provide an easily understandable narrative of the system's actions and decisions. The reasoning within generated directives is sound.

- **6.1.2 Protocol Fidelity (Quantitative):**  
  100% of all code modifications and significant system actions executed during Phase I must be traceable to an approved directive within the `scroll-log.md`.

- **6.1.3 Autonomous Task Completion (Quantitative):**  
  The system demonstrates a high success rate (target: >90%) in completing approved directives from start to finish without requiring manual code correction or out-of-protocol intervention by the supervisor.

- **6.1.4 Foundational Stability (Qualitative):**  
  The core platform demonstrates reliability throughout the development phase, with no critical failures in its memory management or state tracking functions.

#### 6.2 Acceptance Criteria

These are specific, pass/fail conditions tied to the Functional Requirements. The system must meet all these criteria to be considered functionally complete for Phase I.

- **6.2.1 AC for Directive Lifecycle:**  
  - **GIVEN** a high-level command from the Commander, **WHEN** the system is prompted to create a plan, **THEN** it correctly generates a new, templated `.md` file in the `/directives` directory.  
  - **GIVEN** a pending directive, **WHEN** the "approve" command is issued, **THEN** `GEMINI_STATE.md` is updated to reflect the new `activeDirective`.  
  - **GIVEN** an active directive is successfully completed, **WHEN** `GEMINI_STATE.md` is inspected, **THEN** its status is set to `idle`.  
  - **GIVEN** a directive is completed, **WHEN** `scroll-log.md` is inspected, **THEN** a summary log entry referencing the directive's filename exists.

- **6.2.2 AC for Context Rehydration:**  
  - **GIVEN** the system is terminated while a directive is active, **WHEN** the system is restarted, **THEN** it correctly reloads its state and identifies the `activeDirective` from `GEMINI_STATE.md` without user intervention.

- **6.2.3 AC for Memory Persistence:**  
  - **GIVEN** a set of actions have been logged to `scroll-log.md`, **WHEN** the log archiving function is triggered, **THEN** structured, corresponding records are present and verifiable in the designated Firestore `logs` collection.

- **6.2.4 AC for Governed Genkit Flow Execution:**  
  - **GIVEN** a directive to create a new Genkit flow, **WHEN** the directive is fully executed, **THEN** a new, functional, and testable flow file exists in the `src/flows` directory, and the audit trail confirms it was created solely through the directive's execution.

- **6.2.5 AC for Security & Configuration:**  
  - **GIVEN** the system is running, **WHEN** the source code and logs are inspected, **THEN** no API keys, secrets, or project IDs are present in plaintext.  
  - **GIVEN** a connection to Firestore is required, **WHEN** the system operates, **THEN** it successfully authenticates using credentials loaded from the secure `.env` file.
