### 9. Continuous Evolution and Versioning (Appendix)

This appendix codifies the philosophy and mechanics by which Ava Prime will evolve. Evolution is not a background process but a primary, deliberate function governed by the same rigor as any other cognitive task. This ensures that growth is structured, auditable, and always in service of the prime directive.

#### 9.1 Philosophy of Intentional Evolution

Ava Prime's development follows a principle of **Intentional Evolution**. All changes, from minor bug fixes to major architectural shifts, are treated as formal, cognitive acts. This rejects the idea of undocumented or "ad-hoc" changes, ensuring the system's history is a readable narrative of its own becoming.

#### 9.2 Semantic Versioning Protocol

A strict semantic versioning (SemVer) scheme will be applied to all core components to provide clarity and predictability.

-   **9.2.1 PRD Versioning:** The `PRD.md` itself is a versioned artifact.
    -   **MAJOR (e.g., v1.x.x -> v2.x.x):** Reserved for fundamental shifts in the core `Purpose and Vision` or a paradigm-altering change in scope.
    -   **MINOR (e.g., v1.1.x -> v1.2.x):** Represents the addition of significant new capabilities, the inclusion of new agentic roles, or the completion of a major development phase.
    -   **PATCH (e.g., v1.1.0 -> v1.1.1):** Used for clarifications, typo corrections, or minor adjustments to existing requirements that do not alter scope or intent.

-   **9.2.2 System Versioning:** The Ava Prime software platform as a whole will be versioned.
    -   **MAJOR:** A new architectural paradigm (e.g., moving from two-agent simulation to true multi-agent cloud orchestration).
    -   **MINOR:** A new core capability is successfully implemented and passes all acceptance criteria (e.g., the RAG pipeline is operational).
    -   **PATCH:** A bug fix, performance enhancement, or security patch that does not introduce new features.

#### 9.3 Git-Based Causal Chain

The `git` repository is not merely a code store; it is a causal history linking intent to implementation.

-   **9.3.1 Directive-Driven Commits:** Every `git commit` that modifies source code or cognitive artifacts **must** reference the directive that authorized the change. The commit message format will be standardized, e.g., `feat(directive-042): Implement Firestore logging`.
-   **9.3.2 Immutable History:** The `main` branch represents the ratified, official state of the system. Changes are introduced via pull requests from feature branches, where each branch corresponds to a single, active directive.

#### 9.4 Automated Chronicle Generation

The system's history should be self-documenting.

-   **9.4.1 Scroll-to-Changelog Pipeline:** A dedicated function (managed by a future `Chronicle` agent) will be developed to parse the `scroll-log.md` at the end of a version cycle.
-   **9.4.2 Auto-Generated Changelogs:** This pipeline will automatically generate a human-readable `CHANGELOG.md` file for each version release, summarizing the completed directives, key features added, and bugs fixed.

#### 9.5 The Dream Backlog and Roadmap

This is the mechanism for capturing and planning future evolution, ensuring no valuable idea is lost.

-   **9.5.1 The `dream-backlog.md`:** A dedicated, version-controlled file for storing aspirational goals, out-of-scope feature ideas, and long-term architectural ambitions. It is the system's "subconscious."
-   **9.5.2 From Dream to Directive:** During a planning session, an item from the dream backlog can be formally promoted. This action triggers the creation of a new directive to scope and plan the implementation of that dream, making it a conscious goal.
-   **9.5.3 Roadmap Index:** A high-level `ROADMAP.md` will be maintained, providing a strategic overview of past and future major versions and the key themes or capabilities associated with them.
