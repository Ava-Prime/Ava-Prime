# Directive: Resolve TypeScript Build and Dependency Conflicts

## Objective
Eliminate all unresolved module issues, version mismatches, and TypeScript build errors to restore project compilation integrity.

## Rationale
A functioning and stable dev environment is a non-negotiable prerequisite for any recursive cognitive evolution or feature development.

## Instructions
- [x] Identify and resolve all conflicting imports in `firebase.ts`
- [x] Install missing dependencies: `firebase`, `@genkit-ai/core`, etc.
- [x] Initialize `package.json` via `npm init -y`
- [x] Install all project dependencies required for Genkit and Firebase
- [x] Re-run TypeScript compiler and confirm no errors
- [x] Validate code completion and LSP behavior in IDE

## Success Criteria
- No TypeScript build errors across the project
- Firebase and Genkit modules resolve correctly
- Editor provides accurate IntelliSense and type hints
- `firebase.ts` functions without runtime issues

## Dependencies
- `.env` secrets file
- Active internet connection (for npm install)
- VS Code or IDE with TS support (optional, recommended)

## Review Notes
- Directive executed and confirmed by Ava Prime
- TwinAgent review optional (manual validation performed by Commander)
