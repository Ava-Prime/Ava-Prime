### 3. Functional Requirements

This section details the specific capabilities and functions the Ava Prime platform must perform to meet the objectives of Phase I: Memory Cortex. These requirements are the building blocks of the system's cognitive architecture.

#### 3.1 The Directive Protocol Engine

The core of the system's ability to think and act with intention.

- **3.1.1 Directive Creation:** The system, upon receiving a high-level command from a user (the Commander), shall be capable of generating a new directive file (`<task-name>.md`) within the `/directives` directory, pre-populated with the standard template sections (Objective, Rationale, Instructions, etc.).
- **3.1.2 Directive State Tracking:** The system shall maintain the current operational focus by updating `GEMINI_STATE.md` to point to the `activeDirective`. When no directive is active, this state shall be explicitly marked as `idle`.
- **3.1.3 Directive Review & Approval Simulation:** The protocol shall pause after drafting a new directive, awaiting an explicit "approval" command from the user. This simulates the review step between Ava and Phoenix.
- **3.1.4 Sequential Instruction Execution:** Once a directive is active, the system shall read and execute the `Instructions` section in a sequential, step-by-step manner. It shall not proceed to the next instruction until the current one is completed or has failed.
- **3.1.5 Sub-Task Management:** The system must be able to break down complex instructions into smaller, atomic sub-tasks.
- **3.1.6 Execution Logging:** The system shall write a log entry to `scroll-log.md` upon the successful completion of each major step within a directive, referencing the parent directive's filename.

#### 3.2 Cognitive Artifact Management

The system's ability to read and write to its own memory and constitutional documents.

- **3.2.1 Read Access:** The system must be able to read and parse all core cognitive artifacts, including the PRD, `GEMINI_STATE.md`, `scroll-log.md`, and all files within the `directives/` and `src/` directories.
- **3.2.2 Write Access:** The system must have permission to create, modify, and append to `scroll-log.md`, `GEMINI_STATE.md`, `todo-list.md`, and any files generated as part of a directive's execution (e.g., new source code files).
- **3.2.3 Constitutional Integrity:** The system shall not be permitted to directly modify the `PRD.md` outside of a specific, approved directive whose explicit objective is to amend the PRD.

#### 3.3 Memory Persistence Layer

The system's connection to its long-term memory.

- **3.3.1 Firestore Connection:** The system shall establish a secure, authenticated connection to the designated Google Cloud Firestore database using credentials loaded via the Secure Configuration service.
- **3.3.2 Log Archiving:** The system shall provide a function to automatically archive entries from the text-based `scroll-log.md` into a structured `logs` collection in Firestore.
- **3.3.3 State Persistence:** The system shall be able to save and retrieve key state information (e.g., the content of `GEMINI_STATE.md` or a summary of a completed directive) to a `states` collection in Firestore.

#### 3.4 Agent Core & Context Management

The agent's fundamental awareness and operational state.

- **3.4.1 Context Rehydration on Startup:** Upon initialization, the system's first action shall be to read the core cognitive artifacts to load its current mission, state, and history.
- **3.4.2 State Awareness:** The system must be able to query its internal state to answer questions such as "What is our active directive?" or "What was the last action logged?".
- **3.4.3 Secure Configuration Service:** The system shall initialize a service (e.g., using `dotenv`) that loads API keys and project IDs from a `.env` file and makes them available to other services (like the Firestore connection) without exposing them in the source code.

#### 3.5 Governed Flow Execution

The system's ability to use its tools to build.

- **3.5.1 Genkit Flow Integration:** The system must be able to define, configure, and initialize Genkit flows.
- **3.5.2 Directive-Driven Development:** The entire lifecycle of creating, testing, and deploying a Genkit flow must be achievable by following the instructions within an approved directive.
