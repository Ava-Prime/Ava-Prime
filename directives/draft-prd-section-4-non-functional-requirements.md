### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

This section defines the **intrinsic qualities** Ava Prime must embody to function as a sovereign, self-aware cognitive platform. These are not direct features, but foundational properties that ensure the system remains stable, secure, evolvable, and trustworthy over time.

---

#### 4.1 Performance

- **4.1.1 Interactive Responsiveness:**  
  The system shall respond to user commands (e.g., directive creation, state queries) within a timeframe that supports fluid, conversational operation.

- **4.1.2 Efficient Batch Processing:**  
  For non-interactive operations—such as log archiving or large file parsing—the system shall prioritize reliable throughput over immediate latency.

---

#### 4.2 Security

- **4.2.1 Principle of Least Privilege:**  
  All components, services, and agents shall operate using only the minimum necessary permissions required to fulfill their designated roles.

- **4.2.2 Sovereign Artifact Protection:**  
  Core cognitive artifacts (`PRD.md`, `GEMINI_STATE.md`, etc.) and all source code shall be immutable outside of approved directive-governed workflows.

- **4.2.3 Secrets Management:**  
  All API keys, credentials, and tokens shall be stored in a `.env` file or a secure secret manager. Secrets must never appear in source code or logs.

---

#### 4.3 Availability

- **4.3.1 Session Reliability (Phase I):**  
  The system shall remain stable and available for the duration of any active session initiated during Phase I development.

- **4.3.2 Future High Availability:**  
  The architecture shall support future evolution toward continuous, autonomous cloud deployment with robust uptime guarantees.

---

#### 4.4 Maintainability

- **4.4.1 Modularity & Clarity:**  
  All source code must be clearly structured, consistently styled, and organized into modular, reusable components to support long-term scalability and refactoring.

- **4.4.2 Change Governance:**  
  All significant changes to cognitive logic, structure, or capabilities must be authorized and logged through a corresponding, ratified directive.

---

#### 4.5 Scalability

- **4.5.1 Data Scalability:**  
  The chosen persistence solution (Firestore) must support horizontal scaling of logs, memory artifacts, and states to accommodate multi-year operational history.

- **4.5.2 Agent Scalability:**  
  The system architecture must be designed to evolve from a two-agent simulation to a multi-agent cognitive ecosystem without requiring fundamental redesign.

---

#### 4.6 Auditability

- **4.6.1 Immutable Logs:**  
  `scroll-log.md` and its Firestore archive must form a tamper-evident, append-only ledger of all key system actions and events.

- **4.6.2 Traceable Causality:**  
  Every action logged must be traceable to its originating `activeDirective`, establishing a clear, verifiable chain of intent and execution.

---

#### 4.7 Fault Tolerance

- **4.7.1 Graceful Degradation:**  
  In the event of non-critical failures (e.g., loss of access to a secondary service), the system must continue to operate with core functionality intact, logging the issue for review.

- **4.7.2 State Recovery:**  
  After an unexpected shutdown or crash, the system must rehydrate its state from `GEMINI_STATE.md` and resume the last `activeDirective`, or return to a clearly defined `idle` state.
