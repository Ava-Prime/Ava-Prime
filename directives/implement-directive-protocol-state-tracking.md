# Directive: Implement Directive Protocol State Tracking

## Objective
Activate Ava Primeâ€™s recursive self-tracking and cognitive logging architecture by ensuring directives are actively tracked and reflected in GEMINI_STATE.md and scroll-log.md.

## Rationale
This enables persistent memory of the current task, clear traceability between instructions and actions, and the foundation for autonomous recursive cognition.

## Instructions
- [x] Create `GEMINI_STATE.md` to store the currently active directive
- [x] Mark `implement-directive-protocol-state-tracking.md` as active
- [x] Append a summary of this directive's activation to `scroll-log.md`
- [ ] Maintain `GEMINI_STATE.md` as a single source of current focus
- [ ] Require updates to `GEMINI_STATE.md` on any directive switch
- [ ] Ensure scrolls reference the directive that spawned them

## Success Criteria
- `GEMINI_STATE.md` accurately reflects current task
- Directive is fully logged and linked in scroll-log
- System can trace origins of any change or event to a directive

## Dependencies
- `scroll-log.md`
- `directive-template.md`

## Review Notes
- This directive will become a recursive system requirement
- Gemini and TwinAgent must enforce compliance going forward
