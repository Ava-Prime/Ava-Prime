# Codessa OS — Master Business Strategy & Development Roadmap  
## Document 4.4: The Technology Stack

---

### I. Introduction: A Modern, Scalable Foundation

Codessa OS is designed from the ground up to be **reliable, intelligent, and scalable**.  
This technology stack has been deliberately composed to:

- Accelerate product development
- Enable seamless integration across modules
- Support rapid iteration
- Future-proof the architecture for OmniAI and beyond

This is not a list of tools—it is a **unified ecosystem**, selected with precision to deliver on the platform’s ambitious promise.

### II. The Core Application Stack

#### Frontend (Mobile App): **React Native**
- **Why:** A single codebase for iOS and Android
- **Benefits:** Rapid iteration, access to native APIs (camera, GPS), strong ecosystem
- **Use Cases:** On-site quoting, photo documentation, technician workflows

#### Frontend (Web Dashboard): **React + Next.js**
- **Why:** Powerful rendering capabilities, dynamic routing, developer efficiency
- **Benefits:** Fast-loading dashboards for Estate Managers, Admins
- **Synergy:** Shared design system and code patterns with React Native

---

### III. The Backend & Data Stack (The "Brain and Spine")

Codessa runs on **Google Cloud + Firebase**, delivering real-time capabilities and global scalability.

#### Core Backend Logic: **Firebase Cloud Functions**
- **Why:** Serverless = No infrastructure to manage
- **Use Cases:** Job creation, timeline updates, notification triggers, quote validation

#### Primary Database: **Google Firestore**
- **Why:** Document-oriented, scalable, real-time
- **Why it fits:** Perfect for the Unified Job Timeline structure  
- **Real-time sync:** Critical for collaboration and update transparency

#### User Authentication: **Firebase Auth**
- **Security:** Supports email/password, OTP, social auth
- **Ease:** Built-in security best practices, minimal setup

#### File Storage: **Firebase Storage**
- **Purpose:** Stores all images, videos, PDFs, and compliance docs
- **Scale:** Optimized for media-heavy use cases in the field

---

### IV. The Intelligent Core Stack (OmniAI)

This is the AI layer that powers **embedded intelligence** and the **OmniAI Hypervisor**.

#### Primary Platform: **Google Cloud Vertex AI**
- **Purpose:** Build and deploy ML models
- **Models Used:**  
  - **Gemini Pro / Flash** for multimodal reasoning and generation  
  - **PaLM models** for structured code and knowledge recall  

#### Vector Intelligence: **Firestore + Vector Search Extension**
- **Purpose:** Embedding-based search on job timelines, SANS standards, manuals
- **Use Case:** Compliance Codex, smart quoting, semantic search in reports

#### AI Workflow Orchestration: **LangChain / Genkit**
- **Why:** Chaining LLM calls + external APIs + Firestore interactions
- **Example:**  
  > “Analyze this geyser photo → check relevant CoC rules → draft technician instructions”

---

### V. Third-Party API Integrations

#### Payments:
- **Primary:** Stripe  
- **SA-specific options:** Yoco / Paystack (mobile PoS, EFT, ZAR-native solutions)

#### Maps & Routing:
- **Google Maps Platform**
  - Route planning
  - Travel time estimation
  - Geofencing for technician dispatch

#### Communications:
- **Twilio (SMS & WhatsApp)** for intelligent, event-based alerts

#### Accounting Sync:
- **QuickBooks / Xero / Sage APIs**
  - Sync invoicing, job costing, and vendor payments  
  - Enable one-click export of Codessa job financials to accounting software

---

### VI. Conclusion: Built for Tomorrow

Codessa’s stack is a **cloud-native, serverless**, and **AI-ready foundation**.

It empowers us to:
- Rapidly build and iterate
- Scale to thousands of jobs across the country
- Embed systemic intelligence into every workflow

This is not just a stack for an MVP.  
It is a stack for a **living, evolving product**—ready to deliver on the vision of a **Unified Intelligence Platform**.
