# Codessa OS ‚Äî Master Business Strategy & Development Roadmap  
## Document 4.2: The Four Foundational Pillars

---

### I. Introduction: From Principle to Platform

The **Unified Job Timeline** defines *how* Codessa structures data.  
The **Four Foundational Pillars** define *what* Codessa delivers.

These are the **high-level, user-facing modules** that comprise the core functionality of the Codessa OS.

Each pillar is a collection of tightly integrated tools, solving a specific set of real-world problems.  
They are not siloed applications‚Äî**each one reads from and writes to the Unified Job Timeline**, creating a unified, intelligent, and seamless platform.
