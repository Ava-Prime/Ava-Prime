# Document 4.6 â€” Security & Data Integrity: Safeguarding Trust at Every Layer

## I. Introduction: Trust as Infrastructure

Security is not a feature; it is a foundational obligation. In Codessa OS, where jobs involve private homes, sensitive documentation, legal compliance, and financial transactions, maintaining user trust through rigorous security and data integrity protocols is paramount.

This document outlines the principles, mechanisms, and protocols that ensure our platform not only complies with best practices but exceeds themâ€”embedding protection, privacy, and auditability into the very fabric of our architecture.

## II. Security Architecture Overview

Codessa's security model is structured around **three concentric layers** of defense:

### 1. **Platform-Level Security (Infrastructure)**
- **Authentication & Authorization:** All users are authenticated via **Firebase Authentication**, supporting email, phone, and OAuth (Google, Apple) with **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** available for admins.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access to data is scoped by role (e.g., tradesperson, client, estate manager, admin) using Firebase Firestore's granular **security rules**.
- **Serverless by Design:** Codessa uses **Firebase Cloud Functions**, which automatically isolate execution contexts, minimizing attack surfaces and vulnerabilities.

### 2. **Data-Level Security (Integrity & Confidentiality)**
- **End-to-End Encryption:** All data is encrypted **in transit** using HTTPS/TLS 1.3 and **at rest** using Google Cloudâ€™s encryption standards (AES-256).
- **Immutable Job Timeline:** All core job events are stored in a write-once, append-only format, ensuring a **tamper-proof audit trail**.
- **Field Media Protections:** All photos, documents, and videos are stored in **Firebase Storage** with secure, time-limited access URLs.

### 3. **User-Level Security (Control & Transparency)**
- **Session Management:** User sessions are protected by secure cookies and auto-expiry. Long-lived tokens are not stored on client devices.
- **User Data Exports:** Users can request a complete export of their data via the client portal to comply with POPIA and GDPR standards.
- **Action Logs:** Sensitive actions (e.g., quote approvals, payment requests, certificate generation) are logged with actor ID, timestamp, and IP metadata.

## III. Data Integrity Protocols

Ensuring data is accurate, uncorrupted, and traceable is critical to our platform's trustworthiness.

### ðŸ”’ Timeline Event Immutability
All job activity is captured as **event objects** that are:
- Time-stamped with ISO 8601 precision.
- Stored with actor metadata and context.
- Append-onlyâ€”events cannot be edited or deleted post-submission.

### ðŸ“„ Document Verification & Hashing
Critical documents (e.g., compliance certificates, job reports) are hashed (SHA-256) at the time of generation. These hashes are stored in the job timeline, allowing for future integrity verification.

### ðŸ“‹ Smart Conflict Resolution
In cases of conflicting input (e.g., technician notes vs. client comments), Codessa employs a **context-aware reconciliation layer** that flags discrepancies and prompts for human resolution, logging both versions in the job record.

## IV. Backup & Disaster Recovery

Codessa is designed to be **resilient to failure** and **recoverable by design**.

- **Automated Daily Backups:** Firestore and Storage are backed up daily using Google Cloud's managed backup services.
- **7-Day Rolling Snapshots:** We maintain rolling snapshots of all key datasets for fast rollback in case of accidental data loss or corruption.
- **Recovery SLA:** In the event of a critical failure, our system can be restored to operational state within **2 hours**, with a maximum data loss window of **24 hours**.

---

## V. Compliance & Regulatory Alignment

Codessa is committed to exceeding baseline compliance with:

- **POPIA (South Africa):** User consent management, data subject access rights, and local hosting via Google Cloudâ€™s South African regions.
- **GDPR (EU):** Data minimization, right to be forgotten, and secure processing by design.
- **SOC 2 & ISO 27001:** While Codessa itself is not yet certified, all cloud services used (Firebase, GCP, Stripe) maintain these certifications, forming a compliant operational baseline.

---

## VI. Security by Design: Culture & Practice

Security is not just technologyâ€”it is a mindset woven into our development and operational culture.

- **Secure DevOps:** Every code commit is automatically scanned using GitHub Advanced Security and secret detection tools.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Admin tools, database access, and third-party integrations are all scoped to the absolute minimum required.
- **Penetration Testing:** External audits will be conducted bi-annually once the platform enters scale phase, supported by bug bounty incentives.

## VII. Conclusion: Trust Built In

Codessa OS isnâ€™t just built for performanceâ€”it is built for **trust**. Every job logged, every photo taken, and every payment processed flows through a system that treats integrity, security, and user control as non-negotiables.

This isn't security as a layer. This is **security as architecture**.
