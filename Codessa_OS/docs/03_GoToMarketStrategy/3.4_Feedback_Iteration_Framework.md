# Codessa OS — Master Business Strategy & Development Roadmap  
## Document 3.4: Feedback & Iteration Framework for the Garden Route Pilot

---

### I. Introduction: From Feedback to Feature

The Garden Route Pilot is not a static demonstration—it is a real-world laboratory. Its primary purpose, beyond model validation, is to generate critical user feedback to forge our MVP into a world-class platform.

Our iteration philosophy is simple:  
**Listen with intent, analyze with clarity, act with speed.**  
We treat our founding partners—both tradespeople and estates—as **co-creators**, not end-users.

---

### II. Feedback Capture Mechanisms

We use a multi-channel approach to ensure comprehensive feedback from all user segments.

#### 1. In-App Feedback Tools
- **Quick Feedback Button**  
  - Always visible in-app  
  - Allows users to submit bugs, feature requests, or general comments  
  - Auto-captures user role, screen, and device info

- **Post-Action Microsurveys**  
  - Triggered after critical actions  
    - E.g., After quote sent: “How easy was it to create that quote?” (1–5 stars)  
    - After job marked complete: “Rate the clarity of the job report” (1–5 stars)

#### 2. Direct & Scheduled Engagement
- **Bi-Weekly Founder's Council Calls**  
  - 30-minute video sessions with Guild Members  
  - Open forum for feedback, suggestions, and issue sharing

- **Monthly Estate Check-Ins**  
  - One-on-one calls with each Pilot Estate’s Estate Manager  
  - Focused on their experience, homeowner feedback, and Estate Dashboard value

- **On-Site Ride-Alongs**  
  - Founder joins Guild tradespeople in the field  
  - Observes real-world platform use, pain points, and workarounds

#### 3. Automated Surveys & Analytics
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**  
  - Surveys at 3 and 6 months post-onboarding  
  - Sent to Tradespeople, Estate Managers, and Homeowners with contracts

- **Platform Analytics**  
  - Feature usage, click paths, and drop-off points  
  - Identifies friction the user may not explicitly report

### III. The Feedback Analysis & Triage Process

All feedback is centralized in the **“Feedback” Notion database**.

#### Step 1: Daily Triage
Each item is tagged by:
- **Type**: Bug / Feature Request / Usability / General  
- **Segment**: Tradesperson / Estate Manager / Homeowner  
- **Priority**: Critical / High / Medium / Low

#### Step 2: Weekly Synthesis
- Core team reviews all tagged feedback  
- Issues are grouped, patterns identified, root causes explored

#### Step 3: Prioritization  
- Based on:
  - **Impact** = Users affected × Severity  
  - **Effort** = Time/Complexity to resolve  
- **Critical bugs** always take precedence

---

### IV. The Iteration & Communication Loop

Acting on feedback is only half the work. **Communicating changes** builds trust and engagement.

#### Development Sprints
- Two-week sprint cycles  
- Rapid fixes and improvements based on triaged feedback

#### Release Notes
- Issued with every version update  
- Clear explanation of what’s new or fixed  
- Feedback source credited (e.g., "Thanks to Founder's Council for suggesting...")

#### Direct Follow-up
- For major bugs or features, follow up directly with the reporter  
- Confirm the fix and express gratitude

#### Roadmap Transparency
- Pilot partners can access a **public roadmap** showing:
  - Current sprint features  
  - Near-term upcoming priorities  
  - Items under consideration

### V. Conclusion: Building a Learning Machine

This framework transforms Codessa from a static product into a **living, learning platform**.  
By systematically listening, responding, and closing the loop, we create:

- A stronger MVP  
- True product-market fit  
- A product that users **trust**, **recommend**, and **love**
