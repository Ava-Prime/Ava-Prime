## Document 3.3: KPIs & Success Metrics for the Garden Route Pilot

### I. Introduction: Measuring What Matters

Our success in the Garden Route Pilot will not be measured by vanity metrics, but by tangible indicators of value creation, user adoption, and business viability. This document outlines the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and success metrics that will serve as our compass during the pilot program.

These metrics are designed to provide a clear, data-driven answer to the most critical question:  
**“Is our platform delivering on its promise?”**

Metrics are organized into three core categories:

1. Guild Adoption  
2. Estate & Client Engagement  
3. Platform & Business Health
